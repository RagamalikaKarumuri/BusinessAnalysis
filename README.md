# BusinessAnalysis Project: Future of Work System Implementation

## Overview

In this group project, create a scenario and developing a comprehensive plan for the implementation of a new system focusing on the future of work within an organization. 
The objective is to understand stakeholder needs, create a reflective and compelling business case, select an appropriate vendor/tool, and create a project plan and timeline.

## Scenario

Create a fictitious organization facing challenges related to the future of work. The scenario should be creative and provide a realistic backdrop for the project.

## Objectives

1. Understand Stakeholder Needs: Conduct research to identify the needs and pain points of stakeholders within the organization. This information will be used to develop a reflective and compelling business case that outlines the problem and the proposed solution.

2. Select Vendor/Tool: Based on the identified needs, select an appropriate vendor or existing tool from the market that aligns with the requirements of the organization. Document the approach taken to make this selection, including factors such as functionality, cost, scalability, and user experience.

3. Create Project Plan and Timeline: Using project management principles, create a detailed project plan and timeline for the implementation of the new system. This plan will articulate the considerations made in the process, including resource allocation, risk management, and stakeholder communication.

## Deliverables

- Business Case: A document outlining the problem statement, objectives, proposed solution, and expected benefits of the new system.
- Vendor/Tool Selection Report: A report detailing the criteria used to select the vendor/tool, the evaluation process, and the rationale behind the final decision.
- Project Plan and Timeline: A comprehensive project plan outlining the tasks, milestones, timelines, and responsible parties for the implementation of the new system.
